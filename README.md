# Implementation of Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) for Internet of Things (IoT) Based Energy Disaggregation

This repository includes codes, datasets, and node-red flows for nilm using Python and Node-RED. There are two datasets used, dataset countaining power of lamps and public dataset AMPDs. The first dataset containing power of lamps is obtained with measuring the power of five lamps connected in parallel using PZEM-004T sensor which is connected to modul WIFI ESP8266. For the AMPDs dataset, I only use five to seven appliances and accumulate the power of all appliances to get the total power. The accumative total power is the power that will be disaggregated.
